        <h3>1) Centralized identity and access management</h3>
        <blockquote>Attest that your organization has implemented centralized identity and access management solutions</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> MoneyMancer is operated by a single developer (user 0) and does not yet use a centralized IAM platform; access is managed manually through local credentials and repository permissions. The current access control approach and future intent are documented in the Access Control policy on this page, and the server configuration relies on local environment variables for credentials.</p>

        <h3>2) Automated de-provisioning/modification of access</h3>
        <blockquote>Attest that your organization has implemented automated de-provisioning/modification of access for terminated or transferred employees</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> MoneyMancer currently has no automated de-provisioning workflow because it is a single-developer project; access changes are handled manually by removing credentials and repo access. The current manual process is described in the Access Control policy on this page.</p>

        <blockquote>Attest that your organization secures data in-transit communications</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> MoneyMancer communicates with Plaid over HTTPS endpoints, and Plaid Link is loaded from the official HTTPS CDN; other transport security depends on the deployment environment. The Plaid client configuration and the front-end Plaid Link loader are implemented in the repo.</p>

        <blockquote>Attest that your organization has implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the consumer-facing application where Plaid Link is deployed</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> MoneyMancer does not currently have a consumer-facing login or account system; Plaid Link is used in a local demo UI for user 0, so MFA for consumer logins is not implemented. The current front-end implementation is a static demo that launches Plaid Link without user authentication.</p>

        <blockquote>Attest that your organization has implemented role-based access control (RBAC)</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> MoneyMancer does not currently implement RBAC; the API is a single-user, developer-operated service without role distinctions. The current access model is documented in the Access Control policy on this page.</p>

        <p><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> MoneyMancer does not yet enforce MFA through application code on internal systems; access is limited to the single developer and governed by the Access Control policy on this page. MFA enforcement is planned for hosting and source-control accounts when the project expands beyond user 0.</p>

        <blockquote>Attest that your organization uses secure tokens and certificates for authentication</blockquote>
        <p><strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> MoneyMancer authenticates to Plaid using access tokens issued by Plaid and stored server-side; these tokens are required for Plaid API calls and are never exposed in the front-end.
